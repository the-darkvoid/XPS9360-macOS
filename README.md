## Preparation

This repository has been tested against Dell XP 9360 bios version `2.8.1` with Thunderbolt firmware `NVM 26.1`. For best results ensure this is the bios version of the target machine.

## UEFI Variables

In order to run macOS successfully a number of EFI BIOS variables need to be modified. The included Clover bootloader contains an updated `DVMT.efi`, which includes a `setup_var` command to help do just that.

`DVMT.efi` can be launched from Clover directly by renaming it to `Shell64U.efi` in the `tools` folder.

The following variables need to be updated:

| Variable              | Offset | Default value  | Desired value   | Comment                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| CFG Lock              | 0x4de  | 0x01 (Enabled) | 0x00 (Disabled) | Disable CFG Lock to prevent MSR 0x02 errors on boot        |
| DVMT Pre-allocation   | 0x785  | 0x01 (32M)     | 0x06 (192M)     | Increase DVMT pre-allocated size to 192M for QHD+ displays |
| DVMT Total Gfx Memory | 0x786  | 0x01 (128M)    | 0x03 (MAX)      | Increase total gfx memory limit to maximum                 |

## Clover Configuration

All Clover hotpatches are included in source DSL format in the DSDT folder.
If required the script `--compile-dsdt` option can be used to compile any changes to the DSL files into `./CLOVER/ACPI/patched`.

## AppleHDA

In order to support the Realtek ALC256 (ALC3246) codec of the Dell XPS 9360, AppleALC is included with layout-id `56`.

Alternatively, a custom AppleHDA injector can be used.
The script option `--patch-hda` option generates an AppleHDA_ALC256.kext injector and installs it in `/Library/Extensions` for this purpose, in this case the layout-id is `1`.

## Display Profiles

Display profiles for the Sharp LQ133Z1 display (Dell XPS 9360 QHD+) are included in the displays folder.

Profiles can be installed by copying them into `/Users/<username>/Library/ColorSync/Profiles` folder, additionally the macOS built-in `ColorSync` utility can be used to inspect the profiles.

Profiles are configured on a per display basis in the `System Preferences` -> `Display` preferences menu.

## CPU Profile

In order for macOS to effectively manage the power profile of the i7-8550U processor in the Dell XPS 9630 model used here, it is necessary to include a powermanagement profile for `X86PlatformPlugin`.

A pre-built `CPUFriend.kext` and `CPUDataProvider.kext` is included in the `kext` folder for the i7-8550U.

Instructions on how to build a power mangaement profile for any other CPU types can be found here:

## Undervolting

**Warning [undervolting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_voltage_scaling) may render your XPS 9360 unusable**

Essentially it allows your processor to run on a lower voltage than its specifications, reducing the core temperature.

This allows longer battery life and longer turbo boost.

The undervolt settings I use are configured in UEFI, with the following settings:

- Overclock, CFG, WDT & XTU enable  
  `0x4DE` -> `00`  
  `0x64D` -> `01`  
  `0x64E` -> `01`

- Undervolt values:  
  `0x653` -> `0x64` (CPU: -100 mV)  
  `0x655` -> `01`   (Negative voltage for `0x653`)  
  `0x85A` -> `0x1E` (GPU: -30 mV)  
  `0x85C` -> `01`   (Negative voltage for `0x85A`)

Remember, these values work for my specific machine, but might cause any other laptop to fail to boot!
